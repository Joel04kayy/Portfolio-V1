# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This portfolio website is a modern, full-stack application built with Next.js and React, designed to showcase professional experience, skills, and projects. The application implements a component-based architecture that emphasizes reusability and maintainability, with a focus on creating an engaging user experience.

## Technical Architecture
The project leverages modern web development practices and technologies:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based Design**: The application is structured around reusable components, with a clear separation of concerns between UI elements, business logic, and data management.
- **Responsive Design**: Implements a mobile-first approach using TailwindCSS, ensuring optimal viewing experience across all devices.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript to ensure robust type checking and better development experience.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Content**: Interactive sections for projects, experience, and skills with smooth animations
- **PDF Integration**: Seamless PDF viewing capabilities for resume and documents
- **GitHub Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub API for real-time project updates
- **Typewriter Effects**: Engaging text animations using react-simple-typewriter
- **Performance Optimization**: Built-in Next.js optimizations for fast loading and rendering

### Development Practices
- **Modern JavaScript**: Utilizes ES6+ features and modern React patterns
- **Code Organization**: Clear directory structure separating pages, components, and utilities
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first styling with custom configurations
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript implementation for better code reliability and developer experience

## Project Structure
The application follows a modular architecture:
- `/app`: Main application directory containing pages and layouts
- `/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/public`: Static assets and resources
- `/hooks`: Custom React hooks for shared functionality

## Technologies Used
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React PDF for document handling
- GitHub API integration
- Custom animations and transitions

## Development
To run the project locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment
The project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel, with automatic builds and deployments from the main branch.

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced SEO optimization
- Additional interactive features
- Performance monitoring integration
- Expanded project showcase




















This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
